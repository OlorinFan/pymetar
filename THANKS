Thanks goes to...

...Klaus Alexander Seistrup for pointing me to some docs regarding cycles
...Jerome Alet who adapted the ob-parsing code of Spiros Papadimitriou's
   gnome-weather-applet to Python and helped a lot with debugging and 
   developing this library.
...David Leblanc for confirming a parsing bug
